# RRStack Handbook

This handbook is the narrative companion to the API reference. It explains concepts, shows end‑to‑end examples, and consolidates options and types so you can build with confidence.

- Overview — high‑level capabilities and mental model
- Getting started — installation, quick start, and common tasks
- Core API and Types — enumerated methods/arguments/returns and public types
- Configuration & update() — options, baseline, time units, version/notice policy
- Time & timezones — wall time ↔ epoch helpers, DST behavior
- Rule descriptions — plain‑language text (translators, options, examples)
- React — hooks, staged vs compiled, debouncing
- Algorithms — deep dive into coverage, segments, and bounds
- JSON Schema — validating config with an OpenAPI‑safe schema
- Performance — benches and guidance
