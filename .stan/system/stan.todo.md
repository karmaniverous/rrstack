# STAN Development Plan (tracked in .stan/system/stan.todo.md)

When updated: 2025-08-25 (UTC)

ALIASES

- “development plan” / “dev plan” / “implementation plan” / “todo list”
  → <stanPath>/system/stan.todo.md

Purpose

- Single source of truth for the current development plan across chat
  threads.
- The assistant updates this document as code/design advances (remove
  completed items).

Plan management policy

- No refactor-note files are to be written or persisted under
  <stanPath>/refactors.
- At the end of any change set, the assistant provides a commit message
  (first line ≤ 50 chars; body wrapped at 72).
- Completed retention:
  - Keep only a short “Completed (recent)” list (e.g., last 3–5 items or last
    2 weeks). Prune older entries during routine updates.
  - Rely on Git history for the long‑term record of completed work.
  - When a completed item establishes a durable policy, capture that policy
    here (project prompt) and remove it from “Completed”.

Near-term exploration

- After patch “open files”: explore returning terminal focus (CLI) cross‑platform (macOS open -g, Windows start/min/VSC integration). Defer until feasibility is clear.

- Low priority: Investigate sporadic patch failures on long Markdown files (e.g., .stan/system/stan.todo.md)
  - Observation: patch application is reliable overall; when failures occur they are more likely on very long Markdown files.
  - Status: low priority; no immediate action. Track frequency; later consider chunked updates or higher context margins.

Completed (recent)

- TSDoc Phase 2 (initial batch) + targeted tests
  - Added TSDoc to src/stan/init/prompts.ts (no behavior changes).
  - New unit tests:
    • src/stan/patch/jsdiff.apply.test.ts (happy paths, CRLF preservation, --check sandbox, missing target),
    • src/stan/patch/open.test.ts (test gating, missing token warning, spawn call),
    • src/stan/init/prompts.test.ts (readPackageJsonScripts + promptForConfig flows).
  - Expected effect: improved coverage for jsdiff/open/prompts; preserved zero‑warning TSDoc policy.

- Infra: add system‑prompt assembly (parts -> monolith)
  - Introduced gen-system.ts and wired it as prebuild. No content split yet;
    supports incremental migration by adding `.stan/system/parts/*.md`.
- Policy: README trim‑and‑link
  - Documented in project prompt; keep README concise and move deep topics
    to docs, linked from README.

- Knip config: remove redundant ignoreDependencies entry ("auto-changelog").

- Docs: README additions for “API docs and TSDoc” + “Contributing docs style”
  - Clarifies how to run docs generation and contributor TSDoc expectations.

- TSDoc Phase 1 on core APIs (no behavior changes)
  - Added/expanded TSDoc for: config, fs, archive, diff, run plan/exec/service,
    help, version, patch/open.
  - Outcome: TypeDoc/ESLint surface warnings only (formatting), no errors.

- TSDoc hygiene fix pass (warnings → zero)
  - Normalized @param tags with hyphen, avoided dotted names, escaped “>”.
  - Result: TypeDoc and ESLint TSDoc clean (no warnings).

- Patch UX: remove staged-files warning
  - Disabled the staged-overlap warning (no-op helper). Warning added noise and
    did not materially improve outcomes.

- CLI: new stan run semantics (default scripts+archive) + flags
  - Added -p/--plan to print run plan and exit 0 (no side effects).
  - Added -S/--no-scripts (opt out of scripts) with conflicts vs -s/-x.
  - Added -A/--no-archive (opt out of archives); -a overrides -A when both present.
  - Explicit conflict: -c with -A (runtime check).
  - Defaults: no flags → run all scripts, write archives.
  - Tests: semantics, plan-only path, conflicts; stabilized error codes.

- Patch UX: status banners + compact summary
  - Introduced a tiny status helper (TTY vs BORING):
    • success: ✔ / [OK], failure: ✖ / [FAIL], partial: △ / [PARTIAL].
  - service.ts prints status lines and a compact summary on failure.

- Patch service thin‑out (SRP; orchestrator only)
  - src/stan/patch/service.ts is a lean orchestrator; helpers handle the details.

- Docs: Simplified loop diagram & path update

- Open target files on patch failure

- FEEDBACK clipboard (test guard)

- Project prompt: document patch editor‑open behavior

Open (low priority)

- Investigate rare patch failures on very long Markdown files (e.g., dev plan)
  - Track frequency; consider chunked updates or higher context margins later.

Next up (high value)

- System prompt split (incremental) + requirements carry‑forward
  - Create initial parts for high‑churn sections:
    • 20-intake.md, 30-response-format.md, 40-patch-policy.md
  - During this breakup, incorporate an explicit “Self‑contained per turn” rule:
    • Each turn must leave the repo in a self‑contained state so work can resume in a new thread.
    • Re‑emphasize mandatory dev‑plan update and fenced commit message on every change set.
    • Add a short reminder under Operating Model and Response Format.
  - Assemble via `npm run gen:system` and verify no behavior deltas beyond the new rule.
  - Roll remaining sections into parts over time; keep a single runtime file.

- TSDoc Phase 2: continue incrementally
  - Add concise TSDoc (or header rationale) to remaining small utilities where missing.
  - Maintain zero-warning policy for TSDoc lint/TypeDoc.

- Always-on prompt checks (assistant loop)
  - At every turn, the assistant should check:
    • System prompt delta (only for @karmaniverous/stan).
    • Project prompt: does a durable repo-specific rule need to be promoted?
    • Dev plan: update for every material change.
  - Action: maintain this discipline in replies; expand CLI preflight to patch
    command if we decide to automate checks in tooling as well.

- README and CLI help polish
  - Confirm CLI examples align with new flags semantics.
  - Keep the new “API docs and TSDoc” section current as rules evolve.

- README trim
  - Move detail to docs/ pages (CLI semantics, patch guide).
  - Update README to link out and keep quick‑start focused.
  - Ensure links are stable in the published docs site.

Notes: Patch generation learnings (process)

- Prefer small, anchored hunks with a/ and b/ prefixes and ≥3 lines of context.
- Avoid relying on index headers; target working tree content.
- One file per diff block; repeat per file when multiple updates are needed.
- For large Markdown insertions, consider smaller appended blocks or fall back to Full Listing for wholesale rewrites.
